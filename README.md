# codequarters

##Description: 

Code Quarters is a hangout/livestream/weekly thingy where the community from [CodeBuddies.Org](http://codebuddies.org) and friends can get together to explore new technologies in web/app development. Each quarter the community will come together, suggest a few technologies, and build an app (in 3 months time) with those technologies!

What we learn from this process, hopefully, will add to our understanding of our "core" languages which we are all trying to progressively master.
